Just like with Covid, I had a hunch that the situation in the Ukraine would escelate, and look at where we're at now, 9gag is full with coverage of russian tanks, Ukrainian TV's are showing almost dystopian Emergency broadcasts... I guess I just have a sense for that kind of stuff. But out of fear for my own life, I can't tell if it will also reach us.
I just can't help but wonder, what the consequences of all this are going to be. What if Putin succeeds? I doubt he'll be satisfied with just getting Ukraine. The only solution, that I can see, that seems favourable to us is that Putin and his entire regime are taken out, Russia is divided, and new governments are put into place. And the only way I see this succeeding in the long run is, if the Russian people rise up and take what they deserve. 

Right now I'm just glad I live in Switzerland, though Ireland would probably be even nicer, even if they aren't technically neutral.
